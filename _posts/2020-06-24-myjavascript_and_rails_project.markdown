Where do I begin? The last project I had worked on for my portfolio was my Rails project, which I completed and passed back in December. Thanks to COVID-19 and everything that came with that (unemployment, statewide lockdowns, etc.), I requested a transfer to a later cohort and here I am finally submitting my JS/Rails project. My app is quite simple to use as the requirements for the project were pretty fair. A JS front-end with a rails api back-end along with OOJ, AJAX, and a has-many relationship. Coming off of the previous Rails project, this seemed simple enough, however the length of time between projects and to be honest, the length of time since I had done some of the labs, made this an extremely lengthy process. I decided to keep it simple and just focus on the project MVPs. This helped me to focus on the requirements and not all the wishes and dreams I may have had along the way. The app is intended for a user to add video games to a collection that is listed through the app. The are able to add a game title, description, image url, and select a genre from a pre-determined list. Once they click the add button, the game will be listed below all the other game they have added. The user can also delete a game from the list if they saw fit. Ideally, I will eventually add user logins and update functionality, but in order to schedule my review, I'm going to submit as is and may come back to add that functionality later. I think it would also be cool to add a Platform model as video games can be on multiple platforms, but again: MVP for this right now.

On a side note, all my projects up to this point had been based on a Pokemon theme, however there was already a Pokemon lab within this curriculum and it just didn't seem right to me to make another Pokemon themed project, so I changed the theme to video games. Still gaming based, just a little broader.
