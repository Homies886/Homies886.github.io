I decided to keep this project in line with my previous two and build it based on Pokemon. I'm still a huge fan and was hoping to create something fun for Pokemon fans to interact with. I struggled at first to find the model assosciations required for the project and decided to kind of force them into working with one another. While I'm happy that my project is done and that is works, part of me feels I should have chosen a different subject to base my project on and used this current project as just a fun side thing to work on.

Anyway, a little backstory to this, I started working on this project in September as part of the 3/11 part time cohort. Prior to and during the weeks leading up to the project, my grandmother who had been suffering from dementia worsened and the spare time I used work on labs and projects, suddenly disappeared. On the week my project was due, my grandmother passed. A week after her funeral, I still couldn't get in the right headspace to finish my project and then make up 2-3 weeks work of labs on the new curriculum. After speaking with my Education Coach and my Cohort lead, I decided that tranferring to a different cohort would be the best course of action. I took the extra time from switching to a new cohort to work on redoing some of the labs, trying to keep everything "fresh", but still struggled in my quiet time to really focus on coding. I hindsight, I should have picked up finishing my project sooner than I did. Picking up an unfinished idea you had started 2 months prior was not the best idea. I managed to get caught up to speed and finally dive back into the project. Ideally, my project would be a lot prettier and I'm hoping that with the Christmas break we have coming up that I'm able to find some time to really make my project look nicer. Maybe add some stylesheets throughout and possibly some images.

We're our own toughest critics. My project is finished and it works just fine. I just know it could definitely use some polishing. With the new year quickly approaching, I'm resolving to commit 100% of what I have into projects and opportunities that I decide to take on. I'm hoping that translates into me becoming the best software engineer I can be once I graduate.
