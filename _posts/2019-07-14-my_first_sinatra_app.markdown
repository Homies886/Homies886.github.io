To go along with the theme of Pokemon like I used in my CLI project, I decided to base my Sinatra app on Pokemon as well. To be honest, I'm not overly impressed with my app. I really didn't take any risks and it is quite simple, but it's finished and working. I had tried to add another model and kept running into a lot of issues, so I decided to cut it down and keep neat-ish. What I wanted to do was create an app where a Pokemon fan can keep track of all the Pokemon they've caught via any Pokemon game. My app allows them to do that. A user will be able to come to the home page and sign up to create an account. Once they are signed in, they can add pokemon to their list. They can also edit the Pokemon on their list as well as remove them completely. Their data is stored on a database and whenever they sign in, they will be able to see the list that they had created. Again, very simple but effective. In the future, I'd like to add other features such as having users be able to search pokemon they've added by name or an automatic check to see if the pokemon they are adding already exists on their list. That pretty much sums it up!
